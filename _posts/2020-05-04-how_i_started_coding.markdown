I first learned how to code with myspace and I loved everything about it, I used to customize everything, from my background to even my mouse pointers. But around that time I was only about 14 years old. I had no clue I was coding. I thought I was just customizing my page, I didn't really put much thought into what I was doing when it came to coding, to my understanding as a 14 year old I just thought thats just how you customize your profiles. I never knew Tom from Myspace had me learning how to code at the age of 14. 

Then I got older and smartphones were invented, when I got my first iphone I used to mess with it and jailbreak my phone. I hated the regular stock iphones and I loved how I could customize my phone, however I liked and not to mention all the features you could get just by jailbreaking. I know jailbreak is really frowned upon but its something that I love doing and something that I enjoy... and pretty much can't live without. Ever since the whole concept of jailbreaking came about I used to go on blogs post like reddit and started asking people if they could teach me how to code (lol). It was something that I was willing to learn just as a hobby, because the jailbreaking community really had me interested in creating tweaks and new features for the iphone. When I was younger I didn't even know you could turn coding into a career, I just wanted to do it for fun. I never knew software engineering was another word for coding. I always thought it was something about repairing computers, but now that I know theres a career out there that relates to coding I am feeling hopeful for my future, because since I got out of high school I never knew what I wanted to do. I always kept changing my major and I was just so indecisive all the time. But now I can get a career in a dream field of mine and I am super estatic for the future and what it holds for me. I know coding is an intense course and especially in this short amount of time but I really do hope I make it to the end!
