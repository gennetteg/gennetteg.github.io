I first learned how to code with myspace and I loved everything about it, I used to customize everything, from my background to even my mouse pointers. But around that time I was only about 14 years old. I had no clue I was coding. I thought I was just customizing my page, I didn't really put much thought into what I was doing when it came to coding, to my understanding as a 14 year old I just thought thats just how you customize your profiles. I never knew Tom from Myspace had me learning how to code at the age of 14.
